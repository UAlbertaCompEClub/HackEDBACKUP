          "For 24 hours, participants work together in teams of 1 to 5 people to build a project. Teams can work on hardware or software projects. There is no limit on creativity. This hackathon acts as a sort of incubator to your mini projects as it provides a focused time to work on your idea with mentors and workshops to help you along. For the project, absolutely no code can be written before or after the 24 hour window, but feel free to plan or research before hand! At the end of the event, each team will present their work and will be judged for prizes.",
